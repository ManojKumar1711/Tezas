                <p>Passwords are ubiquitous today on any platform, on possibly any website. But to remember so difficult
                    passwords and that too on numerous websites seems daunting and therefore you can devise a project
                    illustrating graphical password strategy. This will allow the user to set passwords in the form of
                    graphical presentation in a certain pattern and later use that pattern to login o the system.
                    Summary: Remembering numerous passwords from various different sites can be difficult for a user. So
                    to provide some flexibility we can provide users a graphical password authentication system where
                    instead of creating a password a user has to select graphical objects in a particular order to keep
                    it as their password. Objective: : In this method, the user is required to select some images (let’s
                    say different chocolates) in a specific pattern (for example dairy milk is followed by 5 stars which
                    is in turn followed by KitKat and so on). Next time the user tries to log in, the images would have
                    been shuffled, but the user will be required to follow the same pattern which was used initially.
                    Every time the user will have to use the same sequence while the images are placed in different
                    ways. This type of authentication is difficult to break since neither brute force nor dictionary
                    attacks could breach it. We need techniques that can be easily implemented and provide better
                    results to this process.</p>

                <p>A false alarm occurs when the security system erroneously detects a dangerous situation that is not
                    really. There are many reasons for false alarms to occur. The consequence of a false alarm, in
                    addition to an unjustified fright for its owners, comes in the form of unnecessary notices to the
                    state security forces or to the security company’s security guards, if applicable. The system is
                    activated as if there had been an intrusion that does not really exist. Why is it important to stop
                    false alarms? Stopping false alarms is important so as not to cause unnecessary warnings to the
                    owners, the police or the surveillance company. When false alarms are continuous it can also cause
                    an unwanted effect: we relax and do not give importance to the true alarm when it occurs. An excess
                    of false alarms in a device can cause its cancellation so that it does not interfere with the
                    security system until corrective maintenance of the device is applied. The false alarm may be
                    masking a malfunction of the security system that can have serious consequences when necessary. An
                    excess of false alarms in companies may result in penalties, an adequate alarm system being
                    mandatory or having to review or replace the security system. The aim of the Problem Statement is to
                    create a smart alarm system to avoid triggering a false alarm.</p>

                <p>Create Online or Offline digital classrooms with low cost, easy-to-use, easy-to-maintain Raspberry Pi
                    devices Context: Digital classrooms open up a world of resources to both teachers and students. They
                    provide teachers the agency to create powerful immersive classroom experiences. It’s a proven fact
                    that students are more engaged in a smart class. However, smart classes are expensive to set up and
                    maintain and, may require additional separate space. Availability of a steady Internet connection is
                    also a problem in many areas. Problem statement: The hackathon team should develop a solution using
                    a reference solution like cheaper and small form factor devices like Raspberry Pi and such and
                    develop a solution to have fully offline solution which can act as both server to serve content, act
                    as data aggregator as well as become device connect with national infrastructures.. Description: The
                    solution shall include the following capabilities.. Solution should have low footprint, cheap and
                    easy to maintain by the locally available resources and skillsets. All parents, students could bring
                    their individual devices to school to sync content with the local server and synchronize data of
                    usage. Solution provides capability for content repository function capable of keeping copy of grade
                    level textbook linked content locally leveraging NDEAR DIKSHA content APIs thus helping all students
                    to synchronize data from their respective devices. Solution should also provide a complete Digital
                    classroom experience - capable of running NDEAR DIKSHA offline solutions..</p>
